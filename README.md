## Prerequisites

- Read my blog post
  [Inversion of Control](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control). Or
  watch
  [Implement Inversion of Control](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-implement-inversion-of-control?pl=kent-s-blog-posts-as-screencasts-eefa540c&af=5236ad)
- The more experience you have with building React abstractions, the more
  helpful this workshop will be for you.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `^10.13 || 12 || 14 || 15`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.

### Exercises

- `src/exercise/00.md`: Background, Exercise Instructions, Extra Credit
- `src/exercise/00.js`: Exercise with Emoji helpers
- `src/__tests__/00.js`: Tests
- `src/final/00.js`: Final version
- `src/final/00.extra-0.js`: Final version of extra credit

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.
